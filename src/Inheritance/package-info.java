package Inheritance;

/*
involves super class and subclass
the subclass inherits members of super class, on top 
of which it can add its own members

is-a relationship can use inheritance.
*/

/*
 Abstract class - cannot be instantiated
 
 define methods , which can be used by inheriting subclass
 
 define abstract methods which the inheriting subclass must implement
 
 provide a common interface which allows the subclass to be interchanged 
 with all other subclasses
 */

/*
traits - partially implemented interfaces
traits can have abstract or abstract methods ( atleast one method should be abstract)
Scala does not allow multiple inheritance
Interface describes a set of methods and properties that are implemented
